A web-based interface matching trending topics in the news with data visualizations generated by contextual data sourced from the government. The purpose of the interface is to help readers/users to make new connections in their understanding and gain deeper insights on trending news topics.

The website shows news feeds from national news sources (eg: The Globe and Mail), and a chart of common terms from current articles. Terms can be selected to filter articles. Clicking on an article displays that articleâ€™s content, along with relevant data from a variety of government open data sources.

The IBM Watson Relationship Extraction service was meant to be used to determine entities and relationships. However, the service was unavailable for most of the competition weekend.
